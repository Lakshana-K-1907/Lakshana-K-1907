## About Me

I am **Lakshana K**, a cybersecurity-focused software developer with strong experience in **security automation, AI-driven workflows, and pentesting tooling**.  
I enjoy building systems that **reduce manual effort**, **improve security visibility**, and **scale reliably** using automation.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Cybersecurity & ethical hacking
- AI-assisted analysis
- Workflow automation (n8n)
- Secure backend and data handling

---

## Current Work

- **Security Automation using n8n**  
  Designing event-driven workflows for data ingestion, AI inference, classification, validation, and reporting.

- **AI-powered Security & Analysis Pipelines**  
  Building automation that integrates **LLMs (Gemini, HuggingFace)** for classification, review, and decision-making.

- **Web Pentest Automation**  
  Developing tools that automate reconnaissance, header analysis, misconfiguration detection, and vulnerability triage.

- **Secure Data Pipelines**  
  Automating validated file ingestion and structured data updates into databases such as **Snowflake**.

- **CTF & Reverse Engineering Practice**  
  Improving exploit methodology, binary analysis, and workflow efficiency using Ghidra and scripting.

## Automation Experience (n8n)

I design **secure, production-style automation workflows** using n8n, combining APIs, AI inference, and database operations with validation and error handling.

### Key Automation Projects

- **YouTube Topic → Top 3 Video Fetcher (Project 10)**  
  Topic-based API pipeline that fetches, ranks, and outputs the most relevant videos for content analysis.

- **Techathon Workflow Automation (Project 18)**  
  Multi-step orchestration workflow handling inputs, validation, branching logic, and final outputs.

- **AI Complaint Classifier (Project 41)**  
  HuggingFace-powered automation for complaint classification and issue triage.

- **Secure File Ingestion into Snowflake (Project 42)**  
  Validated and controlled file ingestion pipeline with preprocessing and error handling.

- **AI-powered Message Reviewer (Project 46)**  
  Automated message analysis workflow using AI for moderation and review use cases.

> Workflow JSONs are not public to avoid exposing API keys and security-sensitive logic.

## Highlight Projects

### Web Pentest Interface
Automated web reconnaissance and vulnerability triage tool performing header checks, fingerprinting, injection pattern detection, and misconfiguration analysis.

### Secure Messaging Prototype (Post-Quantum Cryptography)
Experimental secure messaging system exploring PQC-based key exchange and encrypted communication.

### Deepfake Detection System
AI prototype focused on detecting manipulated media with attention to explainability and inference efficiency.
