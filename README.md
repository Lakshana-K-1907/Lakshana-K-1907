## About Me

- I‚Äôm **Lakshana K**, a cybersecurity-focused software developer who enjoys coding, problem solving, and ethical hacking.  
- I build tools that detect vulnerabilities and contribute to creating safer, more secure systems.  
- I combine hands-on **pentesting** with secure software design and **cryptography research**.  
- Currently enhancing my **CTF**, **PQC**, and **pentesting** skills while building tools for automation and secure application testing.

---

## Current Work

- Building a **Web Pentest Interface** that scans a target URL, runs automated reconnaissance, and detects likely vulnerabilities (header analysis, injection checks, misconfig scans).  
- Improving CTF solving methodology and practical exploitation skills.  
- Experimenting with **Post-Quantum Cryptography** for secure communication systems.  
- Advancing knowledge in **RDBMS** and backend security practices.
