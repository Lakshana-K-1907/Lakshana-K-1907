## Automation Experience (n8n)

I design and maintain **production-style automation workflows** using n8n, integrating APIs, databases, and AI models with strong emphasis on **validation, reliability, and security**.

### Key Automation Projects

- **Topic-to-Top3 YouTube Content Analyzer**  
  Automated extraction and ranking of high-performing content ideas using APIs and NLP logic.

- **Techathon Workflow Automation**  
  Multi-step workflow orchestration handling inputs, validation, branching, and final outputs.

- **AI Complaint Classifier**  
  Hugging Face–powered automation for classifying customer complaints into actionable categories.

- **Secure CSV File Ingestion into Snowflake**  
  Automated ingestion of unclean CSV files with schema detection, validation, and controlled persistence.

- **AI-powered Message Reviewer**  
  Automated message analysis workflow for review, moderation, and internal screening.

> Workflow JSONs are intentionally not public to avoid exposing sensitive logic and API keys.
