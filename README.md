## About Me

- I am Lakshana K, a cybersecurity-focused software developer with a passion for ethical hacking, CTFs, and secure system design.
- I build tools that detect vulnerabilities and help teams harden their software.
- I combine hands-on pentesting with secure development and cryptography research.
- Current focus: improving practical pentesting workflows, post-quantum cryptography experiments, and automation for security tooling.

## Current Work

- Web Pentest Interface: a web tool that accepts a URL, runs automated reconnaissance, and reports likely vulnerabilities (header analysis, injection checks, misconfiguration scans).
- Improving CTF solving methodology and automation scripts.
- Prototyping secure messaging using Post-Quantum Cryptography.
- Strengthening RDBMS security and backend hardening practices.

## Highlight Projects

### Web Pentest Interface
A web application that automates reconnaissance and runs a suite of basic checks to identify likely issues: header analysis, fingerprinting, injection patterns, and misconfiguration detection. Built for quick triage and learning.

### Deepfake Detection System
A machine learning prototype focused on identifying manipulated media with emphasis on explainability and inference speed.

### Secure Messaging App with Post-Quantum Cryptography
A prototype implementing PQC primitives for key exchange and secure message delivery to explore future-proof secure communication.

### Secured KMRL Website
Performed an audit and implemented hardening recommendations for a municipal/transport website, including verification and deployment guidance.

## Experience & Achievements

- Internship: Codsoft — worked on secure features and internal tooling.  
- Participated in multiple hackathons and CTFs with notable placements.  
- TryHackMe: completed 8 rooms and earned 3 badges.  
- TryHackMe Title: [0x3] PATHFINDER.  
- Licensed access to Burp Suite Professional via THM for advanced auditing.

---

## How I Work

- Combine automation and manual verification to maximize the accuracy of security findings.  
- Deliver reproducible proof-of-concepts, remediation steps, and recommended configuration/code changes.  
- Adopt a “secure by design” mindset: assume breach, enforce least privilege, and document fixes clearly.
